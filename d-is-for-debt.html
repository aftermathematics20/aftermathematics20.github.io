I’ll forever be in their debt.” “Thanks for dinner. It’s on me next time.” “If that stranger hadn’t stepped in…” “Do me a favour...?”</p><p>The fabric of human society is made up of this web of mutual obligations and debts. The problem begins when debt becomes QUANTIFIED and MONETISED.</p><p>“Thanks mate, I owe you one” – “I owe you £1”</p><p>Why do we owe so much? In the past four decades: benefits crashed; wages stagnated; housing costs ballooned. We can only maintain access to the commonwealth by getting into debt, by submitting to the grip of death. [Mortgage (from Latin), ‘deathgrip’.]</p><p>If you owe the bank £1000 you have a problem. If we all owe the bank, then it has a problem… but ONLY IF we all act in common</p><p>In Britain, 1989–1990, a mass non-payment campaign led to the poll tax being abolished after just 2 years. 1 in 3 refused their poll tax debt. Since 2010, in the United States, the Debt Collective and Strike Debt! are organising refusal of student debt and other debt.</p><p>In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of people worldwide are refusing to pay rental debts.</p><p>The capitalist economy is fuelled by debt – £1.6 trillion in the UK and growing.</p><p>The capitalist economy is fuelled by credit – by the belief that it will keep going, that tomorrow will be like today. [Credit, from the Latin credere, ‘to believe’.]</p><p>What would happen if we all stopped believing? What would happen if we all started refusing?</p><h6>References</h6><p>We’re indebted to many scholars and experiences for the ideas in this video, but we should give credit to a few. The idea that society is a network of mutual obligations and debts, which are later monetised and quantified, comes from David Graeber, in particular his book <a href="https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/debt/"><em>Debt: The First 5000 Years</em></a>. George Caffentzis’s writing on debt has also influenced us: from him we have borrowed the ‘owing the bank’ example. In 1990 Werner Bonefeld, John Holloway and other comrades in the Edinburgh Conference of Socialist Economists organised a conference on The State, the Poll Tax and Class Struggle. The discussions there got us thinking about capitalism being fuelled by debt, from which follows the idea that anti-debt struggles are immediately anti-capitalist struggles.</p></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://twitter.com/ftermathematics" aria-label="Twitter" class="twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="http://www.aftermathematics.org.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/aftermths" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="http://www.aftermathematics.org.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by love and rage…</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
