(In many ways there’s nothing new about ‘social distancing’).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever we try to overcome those divisions, we find the full force of the state lined up against us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those with money and power act quickly to split us into “good” protesters and “bad” protesters. Legal and illegal. The (blue) ticks and the wrong’uns.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everywhere, we are expected to define ourselves as different from the Other. “We” are OK, but “they” are outsiders. “They” are extremists. “They” have gone too far.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message couldn’t be clearer. “Stay in your lane”. We are constantly urged to stick to our identities – whether they are ones we have chosen or ones that have been forced upon us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we stay in our lane, we behave in ways that are predictable. We are more controllable and the outcomes are known. We stay trapped within our limits as individuals, all travelling in parallel along pre-defined paths.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social movements are X-rated precisely because they represent the unknown. The unquantifiable. The unpredictable.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social movements are X-rated because they are about more than the sum of their parts. They are moments where individualism loses its grip and the power of collective action starts to take hold.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social movements are X-rated because they are multipliers. Against capital’s divisions, they raise the weapon of solidarity. We don’t have money, guns or the weight of the law on our side: our power is built on the joyful creativity of a hybrid multitude.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For our rulers, X is the unforeseen, the intangible, the extra. It’s the unknown variable. They are terrified of X because there is no space for it in their plans.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for us, X is the magic that happens when people gang up and become a new collectivity. X is the mark of refusal and also the beginning of a new world.</span></p><p><strong>REFERENCES AND INSPIRATION</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">X means many things. It’s a mark of refusal but it’s often the way that we vote, and the standard signature for those who can not write their own name. Malcolm X considered “Little” a slave name and chose the “X” to signify his lost tribal name, as well as the “X” that many slaves received as a brand on their upper arm.  It’s worth noting that for some people, “stay in your lane” has an entirely different (and more positive) meaning. It’s used when dickheads start mansplaining or whitesplaining etc. – basically, STFU and listen. In case it’s not obvious, we’re definitely NOT using it in that sense here.</span></p></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://twitter.com/ftermathematics" aria-label="Twitter" class="twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://aftermathematics20.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/aftermths" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://aftermathematics20.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by love and rage…</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
