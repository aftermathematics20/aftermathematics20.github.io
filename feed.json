Why do we live like this and what sort of lives would we rather lead? Who makes the decisions that control our movements? Is there a price on human life?

The idea that society is a network of mutual obligations and debts, which are later monetised and quantified, comes from David Graeber, in particular his book <a href=\"https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/debt/\"><em>Debt: The First 5000 Years</em></a>. George Caffentzis’s writing on debt has also influenced us: from him we have borrowed the ‘owing the bank’ example. In 1990 Werner Bonefeld, John Holloway and other comrades in the Edinburgh Conference of Socialist Economists organised a conference on The State, the Poll Tax and Class Struggle. The discussions there got us thinking about capitalism being fuelled by debt, from which follows the idea that anti-debt struggles are immediately anti-capitalist struggles.</p>",

That’s £9,600,000,000,000. That sounds like a Bad Thing… but what does it actually mean?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Most of the time, “the economy” feels like abstract stuff that’s overwhelming or hard to understand – the Budget, tax policies, trade deals, the FTSE 100…</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But we know that bad news about the economy usually means bad news for us. It means more anxiety about keeping the wolf from the door.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So what is this thing called “the economy”?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In fact, the economy is not “a thing” at all. It’s a lens, a way of looking at human activities. It measures things that are bought and sold. That sounds obvious but it means the economy is only an index of money. If you buy a ready meal from a supermarket and eat it while streaming a film from Am*zon or Netflix, that appears in the figures that make up the economy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But if you cook a home-grown meal for family and friends and spend the evening chatting and putting the world to rights, that appears nowhere.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It might as well have never happened. In other words, if an activity isn’t bought and sold, it doesn’t count. It’s invisible.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s even worse than this… When we look through the lens of “the economy”, we count the cost of building a road and driving a car on it, but we ignore the pollution, the damage to health, the loss of nature, the changing climate…</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Those negative effects have a huge impact on our lives but because they don’t have a price tag, they are literally not counted. Economists call these effects externalities. But there is nothing external to our world, there is no outside.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Governments talk about restarting the economy as if it’s a machine that’s been lying idle. What they really mean is that they want us to start looking at the world again through the lens of buying and selling. They want us to stop weighing our lives against the values we have drawn on for the last few months and start measuring our lives again by money.</p>\n<h6 class=\"p1\">References</h6>\n<p class=\"p1\">There’s a great collection of writing on “the economy” and other lens for understanding our world <a href=\"https://thecommoner.org/\">here</a>​.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

It’s not really true, but it’s a good way of thinking about capitalism.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As a system for organising society, capitalism has to keep expanding: its mantra is grow or die.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Growth might not seem like a bad thing. But when politicians and economists talk of growth, they mean something very specific: growth in GDP (Gross Domestic Product), growth of the economy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Politicians target GDP. Economists measure GDP. The headlines report GDP. But that’s not why it matters.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Leaving aside for the moment that infinite growth is impossible on a finite planet, economic growth matters because it expresses something fundamental about the way our society is currently organised: in capitalist society our lives are measured by money and we must all bow down to money the master.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">GDP and economic growth are blind to inequality. Growth doesn’t care how wealth is distributed just as long as money keeps piling up.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Being ill is good for growth if it means drugs get bought and sold.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Building shoddy houses that fall down within a generation is better for growth than building energy-efficient homes that last for centuries.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Developing ‘leisure facilities’ in green space is good for growth because it means more money changes hands.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Building a megadam is good for growth because the electricity can be sold to factories which produce new stuff to be sold, and which employ the workers who once lived – and loved, and farmed and fished – under the rising waters. (And who still don’t have electric light.)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By any account GDP is a terrible measure of wellbeing. But that doesn’t matter to capital, which just needs to keep growing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And that growth always comes at the expense of us and our environment. It has to be squeezed out of our bodies, our time, our planet.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Economic growth means only subordinating more of our lives to the rule of money and the market.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Economic growth simply means more workers, more work, more plunder.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So when politicians talk of a V-shaped recovery, it’s no wonder we have an entirely different image in mind…</p>",

Shareholders vote themselves dividends of £2,750,000,000. UK government gives Bayer £600,000,000. Bayer is a pharmaceutical company with extensive interests in agricultural and livestock products, hence a big player in global food production. Also owner of Monsanto</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Monsanto: Once producer of Agent Orange, now makes herbicides and genetically modified seeds. Subject to numerous lawsuits for pesticide poisoning and theft of intellectual property from peasant farmers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">June 2020: U Turn on free school meals. Following campaign by Marcus Rashford, Covid Summer Food Fund for schools agreed for less than one quarter of Bayer bailout</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">June 2020: WFP – “Global hunger pandemic”. World Food Programme announces risk of “famine of biblical proportions”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">2020: Famine is nothing new.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Great Hunger. 1845–49 – Around 1,000,000 in Ireland died – roughly 10% of the population. In 1847, while 400,000 people were dying, 4000 ships left Ireland, carrying food to England</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bengal Famine. 1943 – 3,000 000 people in Bengal died, Churchill’s government ignored requests for emergency grain. Rice continued to be exported from India.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yemen. 2020: As many as 10 million people in Yemen are at risk of famine, caused by war. The war was started in 2015 by a 9-country coalition, led by Saudi Arabia . The UK has licensed £6.3 billion of arms sales to the Saudi coalition since 2015</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">1876 – 78, INDIA: 5,500,000 DEAD • 1891–2, RUSSIA: 500,000 DEAD • 1918–19, RWANDA, BURUNDI: 50,000 DEAD • 1928–30, CHINA: BETWEEN 3 AND 10 MILLION DEAD • 1941–44, GREECE: 300,000 DEAD • 1942–43, IRAN: 3 MILLION DEAD • 1967–70, BIAFRA: 2 MILLION DEAD • 1983–85, ETHIOPIA: 1.2 MILLION DEAD • 2004-?, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO, 4 MILLION AND COUNTING • 2017-?, SOUTH SUDAN: NO FINAL TOLL YET</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The verb “to starve” is transitive: it’s something people do to one another, like torture or murder</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hunger and famine are not inevitable and are not “natural disasters”. They are all about power and profit.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Plenty of us don’t accept having hunger forced on us and aren’t going to wait for someone else to solve the problem.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That’s always been the case.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">1700 onwards. Across England, people rebel to protest at the impossible prices of that most basic of foodstuffs, bread. “To keep up the Price of the very Staff of life at such an extravagant Sale, as that the Poor… cannot purchase it, is the greatest Iniquity any Man can be guilty of; it is no less than Murder, nay, the most cruel Murder”. Throughout the 18th Century people all over England gathered, often led by women, and demanded that food be sold at an affordable price.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Egypt, 1977. Thousands take to the streets to protest the price of bread. The Egyptian Bread Riots took only 2 days to force their government to back down on “reforms” imposed by the IMF that removed food subsidies</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">2012–2020: Farmers organise around the world. Across Africa – protests against agribusiness filing “patents” on food. Communities worldwide grow, save and exchange their own seeds.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">2000–2020: Food justice not food charity. Communities organise their own food supplies. People in Barcelona, Andalucia and Nicaragua take food from supermarkets to distribute for free.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hungry people can and do fight back.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We have a hunger for justice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s not only the rich who can use food as a weapon.</p>\n<h6 class=\"p1\">References</h6>\n<p>Ideas in this video come from many conversations and sources.

            "content_html": "<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9t_lh2SxKFs\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">This was supposed to to be the future.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But where are our jetpacks? Our miracle food? Our underwater homes?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of the great myths of capitalism is that it’s an unstoppable force for progress and innovation.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We are constantly told that entrepreneurs are the drivers of new ideas, because of their ceaseless search for profit.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple is a prime example. It’s often paraded as the model of a dynamic, creative corporation. But iPads, iPhones, and iPods are built around twelve key innovations – all of which were developed by publicly funded research and development projects, and millions of hours of free labour gifted by hobbyists, tech enthusiasts and hackers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple’s “ingenuity” boils down to capturing those innovations, enclosing them and turning them into private profits – and mounting ruthless lawsuits against anyone accused of stealing “their” ideas.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s tempting to buy into the myth of people like Apple’s Steve Jobs and Elon Musk at SpaceX. It fits with the fairy-tale image of the lone genius who struggles for years against the odds.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But it doesn’t fit with the facts.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Far from being dynamic, capitalism tends to stifle innovation, it limits our imaginations and it strangles creativity.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Private companies systematically underinvest in research and development because it’s too risky. Under pressure to generate profit, they will always play safe and bring in the easy money.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That’s why so many of the “innovations” on offer turn out to be regurgitations of what already exists.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Our dreams of a better future get swapped for shiny new commodities* (*which have to be upgraded every 18 months).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This mirage of the new also produces a monumentally huge “need” for more work – waged-labour whose only function is to sustain the mirage, marketeers, designers and admen tasked with persuading us we really “need” the latest “revolutionary” iteration.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Our inability to free ourselves from the 60-hour weeks that result leaves us with no space for true invention and creative endeavour.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In a capitalist world, innovation only takes place if it’s sanctioned by wealthy investors – who have a vested interest in everything staying the same.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s no surprise there’s so much research directed at invented automation that will reduce labour costs – and little directed at improving our health and happiness.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the midst of a global pandemic, thousands of scientists are working collaboratively in labs across the world, freely sharing ideas, information and swapping data – standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before. The results of their endeavours will form part of the vast global commonwealth.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But it’s the pharmaceutical companies who will take the plaudits – whilst their directors and shareholders will take the profits.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s not only the pandemic. We’re facing climate change, food insecurity, rising inequality, racism, a crisis in care and more.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We must take on the task of responding to these crises: scientists, garage inventors, makers, ordinary people, commoners.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We must share ideas, create in common and refuse to be stifled by capitalism’s ceaseless quest for profit.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Unlike capitalism’s anointed innovators, we have the imagination.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And unlike capitalism’s anointed innovators, our lives depend upon it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Only we can invent a future.</p>",
