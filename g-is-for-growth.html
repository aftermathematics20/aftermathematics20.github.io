It’s not really true, but it’s a good way of thinking about capitalism.</p><p class="p1">As a system for organising society, capitalism has to keep expanding: its mantra is grow or die.</p><p class="p1">Growth might not seem like a bad thing. But when politicians and economists talk of growth, they mean something very specific: growth in GDP (Gross Domestic Product), growth of the economy.</p><p class="p1">Politicians target GDP. Economists measure GDP. The headlines report GDP. But that’s not why it matters.</p><p class="p1">Leaving aside for the moment that infinite growth is impossible on a finite planet, economic growth matters because it expresses something fundamental about the way our society is currently organised: in capitalist society our lives are measured by money and we must all bow down to money the master.</p><p class="p1">GDP and economic growth are blind to inequality. Growth doesn’t care how wealth is distributed just as long as money keeps piling up.</p><p class="p1">Being ill is good for growth if it means drugs get bought and sold.</p><p class="p1">Building shoddy houses that fall down within a generation is better for growth than building energy-efficient homes that last for centuries.</p><p class="p1">Developing ‘leisure facilities’ in green space is good for growth because it means more money changes hands.</p><p class="p1">Building a megadam is good for growth because the electricity can be sold to factories which produce new stuff to be sold, and which employ the workers who once lived – and loved, and farmed and fished – under the rising waters. (And who still don’t have electric light.)</p><p class="p1">By any account GDP is a terrible measure of wellbeing. But that doesn’t matter to capital, which just needs to keep growing.</p><p class="p1">And that growth always comes at the expense of us and our environment. It has to be squeezed out of our bodies, our time, our planet.</p><p class="p1">Economic growth means only subordinating more of our lives to the rule of money and the market.</p><p class="p1">Economic growth simply means more workers, more work, more plunder.</p><p class="p1">So when politicians talk of a V-shaped recovery, it’s no wonder we have an entirely different image in mind…</p></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://twitter.com/ftermathematics" aria-label="Twitter" class="twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="http://www.aftermathematics.org.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/aftermths" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="http://www.aftermathematics.org.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by love and rage…</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
