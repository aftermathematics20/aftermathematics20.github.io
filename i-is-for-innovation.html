Our miracle food? Our underwater homes?</p><p class="p1">One of the great myths of capitalism is that it’s an unstoppable force for progress and innovation.</p><p class="p1">We are constantly told that entrepreneurs are the drivers of new ideas, because of their ceaseless search for profit.</p><p class="p1">Apple is a prime example. It’s often paraded as the model of a dynamic, creative corporation. But iPads, iPhones, and iPods are built around twelve key innovations – all of which were developed by publicly funded research and development projects, and millions of hours of free labour gifted by hobbyists, tech enthusiasts and hackers.</p><p class="p1">Apple’s “ingenuity” boils down to capturing those innovations, enclosing them and turning them into private profits – and mounting ruthless lawsuits against anyone accused of stealing “their” ideas.</p><p class="p1">It’s tempting to buy into the myth of people like Apple’s Steve Jobs and Elon Musk at SpaceX. It fits with the fairy-tale image of the lone genius who struggles for years against the odds.</p><p class="p1">But it doesn’t fit with the facts.</p><p class="p1">Far from being dynamic, capitalism tends to stifle innovation, it limits our imaginations and it strangles creativity.</p><p class="p1">Private companies systematically underinvest in research and development because it’s too risky. Under pressure to generate profit, they will always play safe and bring in the easy money.</p><p class="p1">That’s why so many of the “innovations” on offer turn out to be regurgitations of what already exists.</p><p class="p1">Our dreams of a better future get swapped for shiny new commodities* (*which have to be upgraded every 18 months).</p><p class="p1">This mirage of the new also produces a monumentally huge “need” for more work – waged-labour whose only function is to sustain the mirage, marketeers, designers and admen tasked with persuading us we really “need” the latest “revolutionary” iteration.</p><p class="p1">Our inability to free ourselves from the 60-hour weeks that result leaves us with no space for true invention and creative endeavour.</p><p class="p1">In a capitalist world, innovation only takes place if it’s sanctioned by wealthy investors – who have a vested interest in everything staying the same.</p><p class="p1">It’s no surprise there’s so much research directed at invented automation that will reduce labour costs – and little directed at improving our health and happiness.</p><p class="p1">In the midst of a global pandemic, thousands of scientists are working collaboratively in labs across the world, freely sharing ideas, information and swapping data – standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before. The results of their endeavours will form part of the vast global commonwealth.</p><p class="p1">But it’s the pharmaceutical companies who will take the plaudits – whilst their directors and shareholders will take the profits.</p><p class="p1">It’s not only the pandemic. We’re facing climate change, food insecurity, rising inequality, racism, a crisis in care and more.</p><p class="p1">We must take on the task of responding to these crises: scientists, garage inventors, makers, ordinary people, commoners.</p><p class="p1">We must share ideas, create in common and refuse to be stifled by capitalism’s ceaseless quest for profit.</p><p class="p1">Unlike capitalism’s anointed innovators, we have the imagination.</p><p class="p1">And unlike capitalism’s anointed innovators, our lives depend upon it.</p><p class="p1">Only we can invent a future.</p></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://twitter.com/ftermathematics" aria-label="Twitter" class="twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="http://www.aftermathematics.org.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/aftermths" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="http://www.aftermathematics.org.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by love and rage…</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
