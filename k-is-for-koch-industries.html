This is blatant and visible manipulation for the purposes of profit.</p><p class="p2">The lies and hate they churn out are all too available in the media and online.</p><p class="p2">And they try to claim credibility by funding scientific institutions like the Smithsonian Museum.</p><p class="p2">As our lives increasingly slip out of control, it’s tempting to see Koch Industries as proof of a conspiracy at the highest level of power.</p><p class="p2">It’s almost reassuring to think that someone somewhere is pulling the levers.</p><p class="p2">But Koch Industries is just one example from a system driven by the need to maximise profit.</p><p class="p2">Put another way: it’d be great to bring down Koch Industries, but there’s another set of bastards waiting to take their place.</p><p class="p2">“And yet, if there is a hidden truth at the centre of the world, it is that the world is something that we make.</p><p class="p2">And that we could just as easily make it differently.”</p><p class="p2">The first World Social Forum took place in Porto Alegre, Brazil,in 2001. The organisers expected to have 3000 people participating, to parallel the numbers attending global capital’s jamboree, the World Economic Forum.</p><p class="p2">Instead, 20,000 people turned up, sharing ideas about ways to change the world.</p><p class="p2">All over the world, people have been meeting and organising and learning.</p><p class="p2">You make plans.
