(Think about how monstrous it would be to charge your relatives and friends for food or affection… )</p><p class="p1">Because LOVE lies at the heart of the common wealth we create, it offers an opening to a different sort of world…</p><p class="p1">We’re not talking here about the romantic ideal of “the happy couple” that is sold to us in every advert. That sort of love doesn’t make the world go round – it holds it right in place.</p><p class="p1">Nor are we talking about the generalised Christian love which seeks to flatten or obliterate all other emotions in exchange for redemption.</p><p class="p1">Instead we mean the open-ended feeling of love as potential.</p><p class="p1">It’s the buzz we get when we fall in love – the crazy notion that we could do ANYTHING and be ANYONE</p><p class="p1">Even though this love might appear to be focused on one person, it goes much further – transforming our relations with everyone around us.</p><p class="p1">Love like this is DANGEROUS – which is why so much effort is spent on forcibly yoking it to coupledom, marriage and reproduction.</p><p class="p1">Love like this is DYNAMIC – it’s a passion that takes us to new places, to new versions of ourselves.</p><p class="p1">Even in the most furious crowds, we see people’s faces TRANSFORMED by this love. It’s the JOY of feeling our shared POWER.</p><p class="p1">It’s only human to RAGE against capitalism in the aftermath of the COVID crisis.</p><p class="p1">But if we are to unfuck this world, to create new worlds, we will do so with LOVE tattooed on the knuckles of one hand and HATE on the other.</p><h6 class="p1">References</h6><p class="p1">Pop culture is saturated with love songs so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zmSeYl3DFU&amp;t=0s">Crass</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Az_GCJnXAI0&amp;t=0s">Public Image Ltd</a> were running through our heads as we wrote this. The line about love and hate tattoos was lifted from The Free Association’s <a href="https://www.freelyassociating.org/six-impossible-things-before-breakfast/">‘Six impossible things before breakfast</a>’, while Silvia Federici writes about the relation between love and the common wealth we create in <a href="http://wealthofthecommons.org/essay/feminism-and-politics-commons">‘Feminism and the politics of the commons in an era of primitive accumulation’</a>. And if you can ignore the heavy North American anarchist tone, carla bergman and Nick Montgomery offer a very readable introduction to Spinoza’s notion of joy in <a href="https://www.akpress.org/joyful-militancy.html"><em>Joyful Militancy: Building Thriving Resistance in Toxic Times</em></a>.</p><p class="p1">The music on this video is Brave Timbers – Hold Onto My Words (Gareth S.
