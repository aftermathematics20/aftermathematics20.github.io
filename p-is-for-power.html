We also think of powerful institutions.</p><p class="p1">We rage against these individuals and institutions because they wield power over us. They limit our own potential, our own power to live our lives, flourish and thrive.</p><p class="p1">When we think of political change we often think of capturing or destroying those institutions. We think of choosing leaders more to our liking.</p><p class="p1">We believe such leaders would grant us more freedom, that their leadership would enable us to thrive – or at least be more able to survive.</p><p class="p1">This way of thinking is back-to-front. It starts in the wrong place. We must begin again…</p><p class="p1">We must begin from below. With us – the 7.8 billion humans alive on our planet. With our potential, with our collective power.</p><p class="p1">We do not choose the circumstances in which we act, in which we exercise power.</p><p class="p1">We can rarely predict the consequences of our actions on the world.</p><p class="p1">Nevertheless it’s these actions – our actions – that make the world and remake it. We are the makers of history.</p><p class="p1">The power of every single powerful person and every single powerful institution derives from us – from our power. Their power is a frozen, alienated form of our own potential.</p><p class="p1">For example, during the first weeks of the COVID pandemic, thousands of mutual aid groups sprang up, as local communities organised to support each other.</p><p class="p1">While those in power hesitated, people exercised their power-to, arranging food deliveries, collecting medicines, offering support to the vulnerable and isolated.</p><p class="p1">Many of these networks and resources were later co-opted by local authorities. Flexible, responsive initiatives were dragged back into local state bureaucracies. Our power-to seemed to recede. It was transformed into power-over.</p><p class="p1">It’s a familiar story.</p><p class="p1">Power-over is always just transformed power-to. It’s us turned against ourselves.</p><p class="p1">Power-over is wholly dependent upon us. Power-over cannot exist without power-to – without us. That is where we find hope.</p><p class="p1">“Protest is like begging the powers that be to dig a well. Direct action is digging the well and daring them to stop you.”</p><p class="p1">When we complain about a fence, we’re turning to power-over. When we tear down the fence ourselves we’re exercising power-to.</p><h6 class="p1">Notes and references</h6><p class="p1">The distinction between power-to and power-over is taken from John Holloway’s book <em>Change the World Without Taking Power</em> (you can read it <a href="https://platypus1917.org/wp-content/uploads/readings/Holloway_Change_the_World.pdf">here</a>). The quotation about protest vis-à-vis direct action is David Graeber’s.</p></div></div><div class="yj6qo ajU"><div id=":1xin" class="ajR" tabindex="0" role="button" data-tooltip="Show trimmed content" aria-label="Show trimmed content" aria-expanded="false"><figure class="ajT"><img loading="lazy" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></div></div></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://twitter.com/ftermathematics" aria-label="Twitter" class="twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="http://www.aftermathematics.org.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/aftermths" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="http://www.aftermathematics.org.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by love and rage…</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
