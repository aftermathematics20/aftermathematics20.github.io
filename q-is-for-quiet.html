This is true for other forms of information, too.</p><p class="p1">When was the last time you felt free to tune out the pummelling of our everyday lives by crisis after crisis?</p><p class="p1">The overwhelming volume of the information in circulation makes it almost impossible to get clarity… let alone the collective space to think and act creatively.</p><p class="p1">It’s crucial that we communicate and share different perspectives, experiences and thoughts. It’s crucial that knowledge is built from below.</p><p class="p1">Those in power bombard us with lies, half-truths, obfuscation, equivocation, and conflicting messages… This is a deliberate strategy. Information noise obstructs our ability to get a grip on the world around us.</p><p class="p1">This level of information overload has been made possible by technological advances. But its real origin lies in the way our lives – beginning from when we’re in school – are organised under contemporary capitalism.</p><p class="p1">The rapid disappearance of secure, permanent contracts, for example, means that workers are trapped in a never-ending labour of self-marketing and brand-curating. ‘Employability’ becomes a job in itself, taking up significant portions of the working week.</p><p class="p1">The result is that we’re not just condemned to exist in a society in which we’re under constant siege from noise: we’re also condemned to produce and perpetuate it ourselves.</p><p class="p1">It doesn’t have to be like this. Capitalist ideas of “noise” and “quiet” stop making sense when we start to assert our power.</p><p class="p1">From wordless fury… to raucous joy… we make different social relations.</p><p class="p1">Neither your silence nor your noise! Just the sounds of worlds being made!</p></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://twitter.com/ftermathematics" aria-label="Twitter" class="twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="http://www.aftermathematics.org.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/aftermths" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="http://www.aftermathematics.org.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by love and rage…</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
