We have to find space to breathe in parks, on footpaths, on hills, by the sea. When we can get at it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a right to roam on just 8% of England. The other 92% remains off limits.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the space we do have access to outside our own homes is corralled, constrained. We might think that it’s public, but very often it’s not. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In England, half the land is in the hands of less than 1% of the population. The rest of us might get to walk across some of it, thanks to many years of campaign and confrontation, but woe betide us if we leave the footpaths. (Although we’d like to point out that it’s not a criminal offence. Yet.)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or if we choose to share our thoughts about something while we’re there.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And over the last few decades, in the UK, the law has been getting tougher and tougher on protecting private property of the rich and corporations from “trespass” by the rest of us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you ask why so much space ended up under the control of so few, you have to wonder who has really trespassed against whom…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And at the same time, those with power and money feel free to interfere in our lives, to trespass on our room to act and to organise together.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sometimes people try to destroy you, precisely because they recognize your power—not because they don’t see it, but because they see it and they don’t want it to exist.” </span></p><h6>NOTES AND REFERENCES</h6><p>There's lots of writing about ownership of land in the UK and struggles over to access to this land. We recommend Brett Christophers's <em><a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/3050-the-new-enclosure">The New Enclosure</a></em> (2018) and Nick Hayes's <em><a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/book-of-trespass-9781526604712/">The Book of Trespass</a></em> (2020). There's also some great pieces (including an interview with Nick Hayes) in the ‘Trespass’ issue of Commoners Choir's 'zine <em>Commontary</em> (available <a href="http://www.commonerschoir.com/Shop.php#!/Commmontary-2-the-Trespass-Issue/p/343005598/category=0">here</a>). The final quotation is from bell hooks (from her 1996 book, <em><a href="https://www.routledge.com/Reel-to-Real-Race-class-and-sex-at-the-movies/hooks/p/book/9780415964807">Reel to Real: Race, class and sex at the movies</a></em>).</p><p><br><br></p></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://twitter.com/ftermathematics" aria-label="Twitter" class="twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="http://www.aftermathematics.org.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/aftermths" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="http://www.aftermathematics.org.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by love and rage…</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
